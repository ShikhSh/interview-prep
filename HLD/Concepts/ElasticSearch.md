# Lucene + Elastic Search + Kibana
## Lucene
A Java-based full-text search library
Powers many search engines (including Elasticsearch)
Offers indexing, relevance scoring, Boolean queries, fuzzy matching, etc.
Not a standalone server — it's embedded in applications or libraries
Think of Lucene as the engine powering full-text search — but you'd rarely use it directly.

## Elastic Search
A distributed, RESTful search and analytics engine built on top of Lucene
Stores structured and unstructured data (logs, metrics, JSON docs)

- Offers:
Full-text search
Filtering
Aggregations (e.g., sum, count, percentiles)
Near real-time indexing
Scales horizontally using shards and replicas

- Use cases:
Log analytics
Product search
Metrics monitoring
Security analytics (SIEM)
Helps with fuzzy searches also - mis-spellings correctedly mapped to right urls in inverted index

## LogStash:
Logstash is an open-source data collection and processing engine, primarily used to ingest, transform, and route log and event data. It acts like an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) tool, purpose-built for streaming logs and structured data into storage and analytics platforms like Elasticsearch or Splunk.

| Use Case                | How Logstash Helps                                              |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Log parsing**         | Extract fields using **Grok filters**, regex, etc.              |
| **Data enrichment**     | Add geolocation, timestamps, user info, etc.                    |
| **Data transformation** | Rename fields, change types, convert formats                    |
| **Protocol bridging**   | Ingest from Kafka or syslog and send to Elasticsearch or Splunk |
| **Conditional routing** | Route different logs to different outputs                       |

| Scenario                                            | Replacement?                   | Why                                                                        |
| --------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Simple log parsing & enrichment**                 | ✅ Flink *can* replace Logstash | Flink can do everything Logstash does — but it's overkill for simple tasks |
| **Complex stream processing, joins, deduplication** | ❌ Logstash can't replace Flink | Logstash doesn’t support stateful or time-based computations               |
| **Low-volume log pipelines with static rules**      | ✅ Logstash is preferred        | Easier to manage with DSL config and plugins                               |
| **High-scale real-time analytics pipeline**         | ✅ Use Flink                    | Logstash isn’t built for high throughput or advanced analytics             |


## Kibana:
A visualization and dashboard tool for data in Elasticsearch
- Lets you:
Search and filter logs
Create charts, graphs, and dashboards
Set up alerts (via Watcher or Elastic Alerting)
Explore traces and metrics (with Elastic Observability)

## With Kafka+Flink:
Kafka: Buffer logs
Flink: Parse JSON, enrich with metadata, transform
Elasticsearch: Store logs in searchable, indexed format
Kibana: Visualize logs, create dashboards, monitor trends

# Splunk
Splunk is a data analytics and observability platform primarily used for searching, monitoring, and analyzing machine-generated data (especially logs) in real time. It's widely adopted in enterprises for log management, application monitoring, security, and incident response.

| Tool                                            | Compared With Splunk                                                        |
| ----------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)** | Open-source alternative; more DIY; less enterprise support                  |
| **Datadog / New Relic**                         | Similar in observability space, but Splunk started as log-centric           |
| **Prometheus + Grafana**                        | Metric-focused, while Splunk excels in **log search and unstructured data** |
| **Fluentd / Logstash**                          | Focused on log shipping; not analytics engines like Splunk                  |


## Spunk and integration with Kafka+Flink:
Kafka: Buffer and transport logs/events
Flink: Transform/enrich/filter logs (e.g., join with metadata, detect anomalies)
Splunk: Ingests raw or processed logs, offers dashboards, search, alerts

| Question                                 | Answer                                                                                                                                                        |
| ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Is Splunk a replacement for Kafka?**   | ❌ No — Splunk is not a messaging broker. Kafka is used for durable, high-throughput log transport.                                                            |
| **Is Splunk a replacement for Flink?**   | ❌ Not really — Flink is a general-purpose, real-time stream processor. Splunk does real-time search & alerting but not as flexible or compute-heavy as Flink. |
| **Can Splunk attach to Kafka or Flink?** | ✅ Yes — Splunk can **ingest data from Kafka** (via connectors) and can **visualize or alert on data processed by Flink**.                                     |
